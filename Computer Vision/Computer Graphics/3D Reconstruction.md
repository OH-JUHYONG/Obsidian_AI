: the task of creating a 3D model or representation of an object or scene from 2D images or other data sources


### Techinques of 3D Reconstruction
##### MVS(Multi-View Stereo)
- extension of stereo vision, whic use multiple images of a scene taken from different viewpoints to reconstruct a detailed 3D model
- dense correspondence matching between image pixels to generate a high-resolution 3D point cloud
##### Depth from Focus
- estimates depth information based on the variations in the focus of an imaging system
- By capturing multiple images with different focus settings, the algorithm analyzes the sharpness of different image region and infers the corresponding depth values
##### Shape from Shading
- utilize the variations in the intensity of an object's surface to infer its 3D shape
##### Volumetric Reconstruction
- to generate 3D representations of objects or scenes using a voxel grid, where each voxel(3D pixel) represents a small volume element

### Application area
##### Robotics and Automation
- enabling robots to perceive their environments, localize themselves, and plan actions accordingly
- Robots equipped with 3D vision systems can navigate complex environments, perform pick-and-place tasks with precision, and collaborate safely with humans in shared workspaces

##### VR
